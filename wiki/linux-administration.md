## What is `Linux` administration

`Linux` administration involves managing [users](./linux.md#user), [groups](./linux.md#group), [permissions](./linux.md#permissions), and system resources on a [`Linux`](./linux.md#what-is-linux) system.

## Change permissions

Changing [permissions](./linux.md#permissions) controls who can read, write, or execute a file or directory, and who owns it.

Commands for changing permissions:

- [`chmod`](#chmod)
- [`chown`](#chown)

### `chmod`

`chmod` changes the permissions of a file or directory.

To set permissions on a file or directory,

[run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

```terminal
chmod <mode> <fd-path>
```

Replace:

- `<mode>` placeholder with the [mode](./linux.md#mode)
- [`<fd-path>` placeholder](./file-system.md#fd-path-placeholder)

### `chown`

`chown` changes the owner and group of a file or directory.

#### Change the owner and group (non-recursive)

To change the owner and group of a file or a directory,

[run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

```terminal
chown <user>:<group> <fd-path>
```

Replace the placeholders:

- [`<user>`](./operating-system.md#user-placeholder)

#### Change the owner and group (recursive)

To change the owner and group recursively for a directory and its contents, add the `-R` flag:

```terminal
chown -R <user>:<group> <fd-path>
```

## Get my current user

1. To get the current user,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   whoami
   ```

## The `sudo` command

`sudo` runs a command with elevated permissions.

To run a command with elevated permissions,

[run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

```terminal
sudo <command>
```

## Create a non-root user

[The user `root`](./linux.md#the-user-root) is useful for initial setup, but daily work should be done with a regular user.

For `Ubuntu`/`Debian` systems:

1. To create a new user,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   sudo adduser <user>
   ```

2. To allow the user to run administrative commands,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   sudo usermod -aG sudo <user>
   ```

3. To switch to that user,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   su - <user>
   ```

4. To verify the current user,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   whoami
   id
   ```

If you plan to log in via `SSH` as that user, copy `authorized_keys` to the new user's home and fix permissions before logging out from `root`.

## Inspect ports

Use the following commands to inspect [ports](./computer-networks.md#port) on a [host](./computer-networks.md#host).

- [See listening TCP ports](#see-listening-tcp-ports)
- [Inspect a specific port](#inspect-a-specific-port)

### See listening TCP ports

To see all listening TCP ports,

[run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

```terminal
ss -ltn
```

### Inspect a specific port

To inspect a specific port,

[run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

```terminal
ss -ltn 'sport = :42000'
```
