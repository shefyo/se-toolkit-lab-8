> This procedure is based on the [`GitHub flow`](./github.md#github-flow).

```text
Issue ➜ Branch ➜ Commits ➜ PR ➜ Review ➜ Merge

The following diagram shows this workflow in the context of repositories:

## Create a `Lab Task` issue

[Create an issue](./github.md#create-an-issue) using the `Lab Task` [issue form](./github.md#issue-form).

## Switch to the `main` branch

[Switch to the `main` branch](./git-vscode.md#switch-to-the-branch) in `VS Code`.

## Pull changes from `main` on `origin`

[Pull changes](./git-vscode.md#pull-changes-from-the-branch-on-remote) from `main` on [`origin`](./github.md#origin).

## Pull changes from `main` on `upstream`

[Pull changes](./git-vscode.md#pull-changes-from-the-branch-on-remote) from `main` on [`upstream`](./github.md#upstream) to get the latest fixes from the instructors' repository.

## Switch to the `<task-branch>`

[Create a new `<task-branch>` and switch to it](./git-vscode.md#switch-to-a-new-branch).

### `<task-branch>`

The [new branch for the task](#switch-to-the-task-branch).

Alternatively, the name of that branch (without `<` and `>`).

## Edit files

[Edit files](./vs-code.md#editor) using `VS Code` to produce changes.

## Commit changes

[Commit changes](./git-vscode.md#commit-changes) to the [`<task-branch>`](#task-branch) to complete the task.

## (Optional) Undo commits

[Undo commits](./git-vscode.md#undo-commits) if necessary.

## Push commits

1. [Publish the branch](./git-vscode.md#publish-the-branch) with your changes if it's not yet published.
2. [Push more commits](./git-vscode.md#push-more-commits) to the published branch if necessary.

## Create a PR to the `main` branch in your fork

[Create a PR](./github.md#create-a-pull-request-in-your-fork) from the branch [`<task-branch>`](#task-branch) to `main`. Replace:

- [`<repo-name>`](../wiki/github.md#repo-name) with `se-toolkit-lab-<N>` (without `<` and `>`) where `<N>` is the number of the lab (example: `se-toolkit-lab-4`)
- [`<branch>`](../wiki/git.md#branch) with [`<task-branch>`](../wiki/git-workflow.md#task-branch)
- [`<repo-owner-github-username>`](../wiki/github.md#repo-owner-github-username) with `inno-se-toolkit`
- [`<your-github-username>`](./github.md#your-github-username)

## Get a PR review

1. [Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review#requesting-reviews-from-collaborators-and-organization-members) a review of the PR from the collaborator.

2. Conduct the PR review together following the [PR review rules](#pr-review-rules).

3. Get the collaborator to approve the PR.
