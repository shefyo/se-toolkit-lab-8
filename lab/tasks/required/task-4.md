# Deploy and Document

Deploy the bot on your VM alongside the backend and document the setup.

## What you will do

Add the bot as a Docker service in your existing `docker-compose.yml`, verify it responds in Telegram, and document the deployment.

## Deliverables

### 1. Bot Dockerfile (`bot/Dockerfile`)

A Dockerfile that builds and runs the bot. Should install dependencies from `bot/requirements.txt` and run the bot entry point.

### 2. Bot service in Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`)

Add a `bot` service to the existing `docker-compose.yml`. The bot should:
- Connect to the backend via Docker network (service name, not `localhost`)
- Read `BOT_TOKEN` and LLM credentials from environment
- Restart unless stopped

### 3. Deployment verification

The bot container runs alongside the backend on your VM. Both services are healthy.

### 4. README update

Add a "Deploy" section to the repo README explaining how to deploy the bot (env vars, docker compose, verification).

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Repo is deployed at `~/se-toolkit-lab-7` on the VM.
- [ ] `git remote get-url origin` at `~/se-toolkit-lab-7` matches the student's GitHub repo.
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` includes a bot service.
- [ ] Bot container is running on the VM (`docker ps` shows it).
- [ ] Backend is still healthy alongside the bot (`curl -sf http://localhost:42002/docs` returns 200).
- [ ] README contains a section with "deploy" in the heading.
- [ ] Bot responds to messages in Telegram (TA-verified during demo).

## Agent instructions

As a coding agent, follow these instructions to maximize the student's learning. This is critical — do not skip these steps.

**Engage before explaining.** Don't lecture — ask a brief question first, let the student think, then fill in the gaps concisely.

**Before writing the Dockerfile:**

> Ask: "Do you know why we use multi-stage Docker builds? What problem do they solve?" Then explain concisely: build dependencies stay in the builder stage, the final image only has runtime — smaller and more secure.

**Before adding the compose service:**

> Ask: "The bot needs to reach the backend. Can it use `localhost`? Why or why not?" Then explain Docker networking: Compose creates a shared network, services reach each other by service name, not `localhost`.

**When debugging connectivity:**

> If the bot container can't reach the backend, ask: "What could cause this? How would you diagnose it?" Then show: `docker compose logs bot`, `docker exec bot curl http://app:8000/items/`, check env vars. Teach the diagnostic process, not just the fix.

**While writing documentation:**

> Ask: "If a new developer cloned this repo, what would they need to know to deploy it?" Use their answer as the outline for the README deploy section.
