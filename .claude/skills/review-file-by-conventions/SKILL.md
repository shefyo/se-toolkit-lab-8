Review a single file for problems — first conceptual and pedagogical issues, then convention violations. The file must be under `lab/tasks/`, `wiki/`, or `contributing/conventions/`.

## Steps

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to get the file path. Accept paths under `lab/tasks/` (e.g., `lab/tasks/setup.md`, `lab/tasks/required/task-2.md`), `wiki/` (e.g., `wiki/web-development.md`), or `contributing/conventions/` (e.g., `contributing/conventions/writing/common.md`). If the path is missing or does not point to a file under one of these directories, ask the user.
2. Read the target file.
3. Read the convention files that apply to the target file:
   - **For `lab/tasks/` files:**
     - [`contributing/conventions/writing/tasks.md`](../../../contributing/conventions/writing/tasks.md) — Section 13 defines the ten review dimensions (D1–D10) for conceptual review; Section 3 and Section 12 define task structure and design principles for convention review
     - [`contributing/conventions/writing/common.md`](../../../contributing/conventions/writing/common.md) — writing conventions (4.1–4.23)
   - **For `wiki/` files:**
     - [`contributing/conventions/writing/common.md`](../../../contributing/conventions/writing/common.md) — writing conventions (4.1–4.23)
     - [`contributing/conventions/writing/wiki.md`](../../../contributing/conventions/writing/wiki.md) — wiki file structure and section patterns
   - **For `contributing/conventions/` files:**
     - [`contributing/conventions/conventions.md`](../../../contributing/conventions/conventions.md) — conventions for writing conventions
4. **Conceptual review** (only for `lab/tasks/` files): Analyse the file against each dimension (D1–D10) from Section 13 of [`contributing/conventions/writing/tasks.md`](../../../contributing/conventions/writing/tasks.md). For each problem found, record: the dimension, the line number(s) or section, a short description, severity (`[High]`, `[Medium]`, or `[Low]`), and a suggested fix.
5. **Convention review**: Go through the target file **line by line**. Check it against **every** convention in the applicable convention files. Flag each violation with its line number.
6. Scan for `<!-- TODO ... -->` comments. Report each one with its line number and the comment text.
7. Scan for empty sections: a heading immediately followed by another heading, a `<!-- TODO ... -->` comment, or end of file, with no real content lines in between. Report each empty section with its line number and heading text.

## Rules

- The convention files are the single source of truth. Check every rule they contain — do not skip any.
- Do not invent rules beyond what the convention files state.
- Be strict: flag every violation, no matter how small.
- Do not fix anything — only report.
- If a convention does not apply to the file (e.g., the file has no Docker commands), skip that category and note "Not applicable."
- For `lab/tasks/setup.md`: skip task-only conventions (Section 3 template, acceptance criteria format). Apply all `common.md` conventions.
- For `contributing/conventions/conventions.md` itself: apply its own rules — the file is self-referential and must comply with the conventions it defines.

## Output format

Write the report to `instructors/file-reviews/<repo-root-path>`, where `<repo-root-path>` is the file's path from the repository root (e.g., `instructors/file-reviews/lab/tasks/setup.md` for `lab/tasks/setup.md`, `instructors/file-reviews/wiki/web-development.md` for `wiki/web-development.md`, `instructors/file-reviews/contributing/conventions/writing/common.md` for `contributing/conventions/writing/common.md`). Create intermediate directories if they do not exist.

The report must be self-contained so another session or agent can act on it without extra context. Structure:

1. **Header** — file path reviewed, date, convention files used.
2. **Conceptual findings** (only for `lab/tasks/` files) — grouped by dimension (D1–D10). Under each dimension, list findings as numbered items with severity, line number(s) or section, description, and suggested fix. If a dimension has no findings, write "No issues found."
3. **Convention findings** — grouped by convention number (e.g., "4.2. Terminal commands", "Section 3. Task document structure"). Under each group, list findings as numbered items with line numbers. If a group has no findings, write "No issues found."
4. **TODOs** — list every `<!-- TODO ... -->` comment with its line number and text. If none, write "No TODOs found."
5. **Empty sections** — list every heading that has no content (only a TODO comment, another heading, or EOF follows). Include line number and heading text. If none, write "No empty sections found."
6. **Summary** — total finding count (conceptual by severity + convention violations + TODOs + empty sections) and a short overall assessment.

After writing the file, print its path in the conversation so the user can find it.
